STS (Seasonal Time System)

STS is an experimental time system that aligns human time with seasonal rhythms. In STS, daytime and nighttime hours are elastic: their duration changes smoothly over the year. Around the summer solstice (Northern Hemisphere) daytime hours are longer and nighttime hours are shorter; around the winter solstice the opposite happens. At equinoxes, both have the same length.

Goals and scope.
STS explores how timekeeping can reflect the annual cycle in a clear and consistent way while removing the need for seasonal clock changes. Instead of switching to Daylight Saving Time twice a year—a change often experienced as disruptive—STS keeps the wall clock stable and lets the hour lengths adapt smoothly to the season. In practical terms this mirrors natural rhythms: when daylight is abundant (summer) activity can naturally “expand,” and when darkness dominates (winter) it can gently “ease back.” The aim is alignment with light–dark cycles, not a promise of productivity gains; any wellbeing benefit is potential and implicit rather than medical or prescriptive.

The model is especially suited to temperate latitudes, roughly 30°–50°, where seasonal amplitude is intuitive and where a large share of the world’s population lives. It remains usable outside this band: near the equator the effect is modest by design; at higher latitudes it cannot solve very long nights or days, yet it can still offer a gentler progression across the year and slightly better use of available daylight than a rigid civil clock. Results do not depend on longitude and assume an idealized reference latitude (~30°) for amplitude.

STS is not a sunrise/sunset clock and does not follow local solar altitude. It uses a single global seasonal reference (UTC 0) and a hemisphere toggle; hour lengths change continuously across the year through a smooth (C¹-continuous) curve constrained by equinox and solstice anchors. This framing is descriptive, not prescriptive: STS adapts hour lengths to daylight, leaving people free to organize their routines as they prefer.
